don't drown

water does breadth first search and moves one block each step
step is when a player moves one block

if the water touches the fire or player then the game is over 
the level is complete when the player presses space and the water is flowed unctroably


future ideas-fog of war so that players needs to loose extra move to explore


TODO: 
	water simulation
	use highmap like animation to make water look like water
	Use texture tiling
